Changing   how  you  
           reportproblems
The  amount  of  computer 
           hardware&   software,   networks,   and  
           supportinginfrastructure  in  Dunn  Hall 
           hasslowly
increased    in   size   and   
           complexityover the recent years.  It has 
           becomea   difficult   task   for   one   
           individualto manage
the service requests 
           (ofover  35  faculty) and the day to day 
           maintenancewithout  a rigorous process.  
           TheUniversity
now  supports  a  central  
           problemreporting   system  through       
           Helpdesk.   All   problems  related  to  
           computerhardware  &
software,  networks, 
           andprinters must now be reported to this 
           system.

Thischange   is   intended  to  
           improveresponse  time  of  dealing  with 
           computerproblems  and service requests.  
           The
followingare  some of the advantages 
           ofusing  this  new system:
1. A built-in 
           trackingand   problem   identification   
           system,
2.Allowing  users  to  check the 
           statusof    requests    and    problem   
           reports,
3.Maintaining    a    central   
           locationfor  the  Local Service Provider 
           andassistants   to  check  for  problem  
           reports.

Oldway to report problems

The 
           currentmethod   used  by  the  faculty,  
           staff,and   students   for   reporting   
           problemsin  Dunn  Hall  is  to  describe 
           your
problemto   our   Local   Service   
           Provider(LSP)   Aregahegn   Negatu  via  
           email,voice     mail,    phone,    or    
           direct
conversation. This method has its 
           obviousproblems  and pitfalls (no record 
           keeping,no  tracking,  etc.).   A number 
           of
assistantsalso support Mr. Negatu for 
           systemsadministration,  and  they do not 
           haveaccess  to his personal email,
voice 
           mail,or mind.  Thus, there is no central 
           placefor Mr. Negatu or his assistants to 
           checkfor  problem  reports.

New  way to 
           reportproblems

All   problems  can  be  
           reportedin  one  of  two  ways:
    The  
           preferred(and  more  reliable) method is 
           usingthe               web               
           page:
http://helpdesk.memphis.edu/and    
           clickingon:   Faculty,  Staff,  Student  
           ServiceRequests.
  If  you cannot access 
           theInternet  then call 8888 and describe 
           yourproblem  to  the attendant.

In both 
           cases,your  problem report will be given 
           aService  Request Number.  Using the web 
           toreport   the   problem,
you  will  be  
           automaticallyemailed the number.  If you 
           called8888,  make  sure  the  attendant  
           givesthis  number  over
the  phone.  The 
           numberis  used to track the progress and 
           statusof  your  request/problem.   Go to 
           thesame                web               
           page:
http://helpdesk.memphis.edu/and    
           clickon:   "check   the  status  of  an  
           existingcall"  and enter the number.

Is 
           yourproblem  taking  a  long time to get 
           fixed?

Ifthe  request  is taking a long 
           timeto  be  fixed  and  the  status  has 
           alreadybeen  checked via the web page or 
           8888,
thenemail  the  LSP  (Mr.  Negatu) 
           yourService  Request  Number and a brief 
           explanation. He will try to address
your 
           problemas  soon as possible.  A priority 
           canbe  assigned  to your service request 
           atreporting  time,  but  the LSP
must do 
           somedaily  priority  assignments.

           methodwill   be   a   more   efficient   
           and
